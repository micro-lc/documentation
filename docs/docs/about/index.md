üéº <micro-lc></micro-lc> is an open source **micro-frontend orchestrator**.

üß± <micro-lc></micro-lc> offers a solution for building **flexible**, **multi-tenant** frontend applications.

üñº <micro-lc></micro-lc> is well suited to build **any type of web application**, from classical top-bar/sidebar 
multi-pages websites, to CMSs, blogs, or even applications with no layout at all.

‚ö° <micro-lc></micro-lc> aims to be as **lightweight** as possible and to improve **web security**. 

üîó <micro-lc></micro-lc> brings together **different micro-frontend patterns** inside the same application.

üèÉ <micro-lc></micro-lc> consists of a core interface that loads, embeds, and orchestrates individual frontend applications
at **runtime**, while providing **configuration options** and useful **out-of-the-box features**.

## Rationale

In a world of frontend monoliths, the [micro-frontend](https://micro-frontends.org/) pattern brings to the frontend world
the benefits [microservice architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) brought to backend development.
We are talking about scalability, technological agnosticism, faster development and delivery time, maintainability, and
governance complexity reduction, just to name a few.

One of the greatest challenges when taking this architectural approach is making sure that all the independent 
micro-frontend application behave in a **cohesive way**, both in terms of user interface (e.g., styling, theming, branding)
and user experience (e.g., state sharing, routing, error handling).

<micro-lc></micro-lc> has been designed to help overcome this challenge, offering the stability and unity of a centralized
orchestrator, while maintaining the flexibility needed to mold the application to each unique use case.

## Features

<micro-lc></micro-lc> supports three different micro-frontend patterns at the same time:
[iframes](guides/applications/iframes.md), [parcels](guides/applications/parcels.md), and
[shadowed components](guides/applications/compose.md).

An **iframe** is an external websites embedded into our application. A **parcel** instead is a fully-fledged (possibly
single-page) application which lives within the context of the main application, but is JS-sandboxed and routed. Finally,
**shadowed components** refer to business logic encapsulation via web components which allows to protect from style leaks
and to scope events using HTML5 elements Shadow DOM.

Orchestration happens at **run-time** so that a JSON (or YAML) configuration is all <micro-lc></micro-lc> needs to add
a new micro-frontend application. Configurations can be **hot-swapped** or edited at run time, meaning a page refresh is
enough to preview your application after config changes.

<micro-lc></micro-lc> provides a **smooth navigation experience** between different applications, SPAs, and iframes 
while wrapping them in a static layout.

It ships as a [CDN bundle](./getting-started.md#import-from-cdn) that can be embedded into HTML pages or other scripts,
and as a [Docker container](./getting-started.md#deploy-docker-container) that can be configured with volumes.

<micro-lc></micro-lc> is heavily inspired by and based on micro-frontend orchestration tools such as 
[single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) and [qiankun](https://qiankun.umijs.org/).

By orchestrating micro-frontend applications, <micro-lc></micro-lc> achieves a fair amount of benefits:
* applications written in **different frameworks** can live together on the same page;
* applications can be deployed **independently**;
* applications can **communicate** through standard APIs leveraging also event-driven patterns.

Compared to other tools, <micro-lc></micro-lc> provides:
* live configuration and preview;
* centralized styling APIs;
* HTML-like composition tools (_lit-html_);
* import map integration (_es-module-shims_).
