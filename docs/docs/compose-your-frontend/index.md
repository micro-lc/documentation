Welcome to a curated collection of guides designed to help you bootstrap your <micro-lc></micro-lc>-based frontend! This tutorial offers a comprehensive walkthrough of <micro-lc></micro-lc> features and recommended practices, empowering you to build an orchestrated frontend from the ground up.

We've structured this guide in a logical, step-by-step manner, progressing from basic concepts to more complex topics. Each step culminates in a JSON configuration, the foundational element of <micro-lc></micro-lc>. We encourage you to test out these configurations in the <micro-lc></micro-lc> <a href="/playground/" target="_blank">playground</a>.

For those interested in a local setup, consider following our [getting started](../getting-started.md) guide. This tutorial also provides previews and areas for copy/pasting, allowing you to easily configure <micro-lc></micro-lc> according to your preferred step.

For the best learning experience, we recommend opening the <a href="/playground/" target="_blank">playground</a> in a separate tab, aligning it side-by-side with this guide, and updating the configuration in the playground as you progress.
