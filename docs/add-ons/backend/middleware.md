```

**Middleware** is a backend middleware responsible for serving <micro-lc></micro-lc> configuration files, applying
some useful [parsing logic](#configurations-parsing) before returning their content. This logic is also distributed
through an [SDK](#sdk) to ease the process of building custom configurations serves.

## Usage

Middleware is available as a Docker image on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/microlc/middleware).

### Environment variables

Middleware it built using Mia-Platform's [custom-plugin-lib](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib), hence it
needs the environment variables outlined in the 
[library documentation](https://github.com/mia-platform/custom-plugin-lib#environment-variables-configuration).

On top of those, Middleware accepts the following environment variables:

|            Name            |   Type   | Required | Description                                                                                 |
|:--------------------------:|:--------:|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RESOURCES_DIRECTORY_PATH` | `string` |    âœ”     | Absolute path of the [directory](#serve-from-file-system) containing resources to be served |
| `CONTENT_TYPE_MAP`         | `string` |          | Stringified JSON object representing a key/value directory to map extensions to `Content-Type` headers |

### Serving from file system

Configuration files and regular files are loaded from file system.
In particular, Middleware searches in the directory specified with the
`RESOURCES_DIRECTORY_PATH` [environment variable](#environment-variables) for any file description not being a folder and, amongst those, also
for JSON (`.json`) and YAML (`.yaml` or `.yml`)
files, (even in subdirectories) and exposes a route for each of them.

:::caution
Since routes are created at service startup, adding or removing files will **not change the exposes routes** until the
service is restarted.

However, since Middleware reloads a file each time its corresponding route is called, any change to the content of a file 
**will be immediately reflected** without need of restarting the service.
:::

For example, given a directory with the following structure:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ orders-config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
    â””â”€â”€ index.js
â””â”€â”€ user-pages
    â”œâ”€â”€ customers-config.yml
    â””â”€â”€ admin-config.json
```

Middleware will expose the following routes:

```text
GET - /config.json
GET - /orders-config.yaml
GET - /lib/index.js
GET - /user-pages/customers-config.yml
GET - /user-pages/admin-config.json
```

## Content Type

By default, Middleware returns a file with the following content types (depending on the file extension)

|       Extension            |   Content-Type header   |
|:--------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| .cjs | application/javascript |
|  .css| text/css|
|  .html| text/html|
|  .js| application/javascript|
|  .json| application/json; charset=utf-8|
|  .mjs| application/javascript|
|  .yaml| text/yaml; charset=utf-8|
|  .yml| text/yaml; charset=utf-8|

Any extension not listed will trigger a default `Content-Type` equal to `text/plain`.
These settings can be overridden by using the `CONTENT_TYPE_MAP` container variable as described
by the following examples

```text
CONTENT_TYPE_MAP='{".mjs,.js": "text/javascript", ".xml": "application/xml"}'
```

which will force Middleware to return on `.mjs` and `.js` the equivalen `text/javascript` Content-Type header and
`application/xml` on XML's files. Keys must be either a single extension or a comma separated list of extensions and values must be strings.

:::caution
Any extension listed in the `CONTENT_TYPE_MAP` will override its previous default value allowing even to change
`Content-Type` for JSON and YAML files which might create problems on `micro-lc` web component configuration dump.
:::

## JSON/YAML manipulation

If the required file ends with `.json`, `.yaml` or `.yml`,
before returning the file, Middleware applies some parsing logics to its content.

### ACL application

Middleware allows you to implement **access control limit** on served files, removing sections of configurations based on
certain properties of the caller. Namely, Middleware considers caller's **groups** and **permissions**.

Caller's **groups** are extracted from request headers, particularly from the header the key of which is specified through
`GROUPS_HEADER_KEY` [environment variable](#environment-variables). The value of the header should be a comma-separated
list of groups (e.g., `"admin,user"`).

Caller's **permissions** are extracted from request headers too. Middleware takes the header the key of which is specified
through `USER_PROPERTIES_HEADER_KEY` [environment variable](#environment-variables) and expects a stringified JSON
object containing a comma-separated list of permissions under the key `permissions` (e.g.,
`"{\"permissions\":"api.users.get,api.users.post"}"`).

ACL expressions can be specified anywhere in configuration using the special key `aclExpression` having as value a
**stringified boolean expression** based on caller's groups and permissions (e.g., 
`groups.admin || permissions.api.users.get`).

:::tip
You can use any combination of groups, permissions and JavaScript operators in you ACL expressions.

For example, the following expressions are all valid:
* `groups.admin && permissions.api.users.get`
* `!groups.developer`
* `permissions.api.users.get || permissions.api.users.post`
* `(groups.admin && !permissions.api.users.post) || permissions.api.users.count.get`
* `(groups.admin === true && permissions.api.users.post === true)`
:::

Middleware evaluates each ACL expression against caller's properties and, if the expression results in a `falsy value`, it
removes from the configuration the **whole object** which the expression is a property of. It then proceeds to remove
any `aclExpression` key left over to not leak server-side logic into the client.

#### Example

Let's consider the following configuration file served under `GET - /middleware/config.json`.

```json
{
  "content": {
    "tag": "div",
    "properties": {
      // highlight-next-line
      "aclExpression": "groups.admin",
      "adminName": "John Doe"
    },
    "content": [
      {
        // highlight-next-line
        "aclExpression": "groups.superadmin || permissions.api.users.get",
        "tag": "button"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The response of the following request

```shell
curl 'https://*********/middleware/config.json' \
  -H 'user-groups: user' \
  -H 'user-properties: { "permissions": "api.users.get" }'
```

will be

```json
{
  "content": {
    "tag": "div",
    "content": [
      {
        "tag": "button"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### References resolution

In order to avoid writing repeating values multiple times in your configurations, Middleware supports references resolutions
following [JSON schema specification](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html#ref). In
particular, if you need to repeat the same value in various places of your configuration, you can **define it once** in
the dedicated top-level key `definitions`, and then **references it** wherever you like using the keyword `$ref` (e.g.,
`{ "dataSchema": { "$ref": "#/definitions/dataSchema" }}`).

Middleware will resolve references in files and will remove the key `definitions` (if any) before serving them. Keep in mind
that Middleware **will throw** if some references cannot be resolved.

#### Example

Let's consider the following configuration file served under `GET - /middleware/config.json`.

```json
{
  "definitions": {
    "clientKey": "some-client-key"
  },
  "content": {
    "tag": "div",
    "properties": {
      "clientKey": {
        // highlight-next-line
        "$ref": "#/definitions/clientKey"
      }
    },
    "content": [
      {
        "tag": "button",
        "properties": {
          "clientKey": {
            // highlight-next-line
            "$ref": "#/definitions/clientKey"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The response of the following request

```shell
curl 'https://*********/middleware/config.json'
```

will be

```json
{
  "definitions": {
    "clientKey": "some-client-key"
  },
  "content": {
    "tag": "div",
    "properties": {
      // highlight-next-line
      "clientKey": "some-client-key"
    },
    "content": [
      {
        "tag": "button",
        "properties": {
          // highlight-next-line
          "clientKey": "some-client-key"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## SDK

The logic under [ACL application](#acl-application) and [references resolution](#references-resolution) is conveniently
shipped in a standalone SDK to ease the implementation of alternative backend solutions.

### Usage

You can install the SDK from NPM

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="pkg-manager">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
```
```shell
npm install @micro-lc/middleware/sdk
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
```
```shell
yarn add @micro-lc/middleware/sdk
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

and import it in your files

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="module">
<TabItem value="common-js" label="CommonJS" default>
```
```javascript
const middlewareSdk = require('@micro-lc/middleware/sdk')
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="modules" label="ECMAScript modules">
```
```javascript
import * as middlewareSdk from '@micro-lc/middleware/sdk'
```
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
