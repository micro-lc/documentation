This is exactly the reason why we at [Mia-Platform](https://mia-platform.eu/) developed <micro-lc></micro-lc> and released it as open-source.  \\nIf you are not familiar with it, in a nutshell, **<micro-lc></micro-lc> is an open-source micro-frontends orchestrator**: you can find further information in the [documentation introduction](/docs), or you can read this [blog post](https://blog.mia-platform.eu/en/micro-lc-the-new-open-source-micro-fronted-orchestrator) to get a more discursive overview.\\n\\nWe are proud to announce <micro-lc></micro-lc> **v2.0**! A lot of new features have been implemented and optimized, making the tool more powerful than ever. Micro-frontends keep evolving, and so does <micro-lc></micro-lc>.\\n\\nLet\'s take a closer look to what has changed.\\n\\n## A new live playground\\n\\nOne of the main news is the **new [playground](/playground/) available on the website**. Here you can try <micro-lc></micro-lc> live, without the need to install anything: in the box on the right you will directly see the result. You are free to do all the experiments you like and test the full potential of <micro-lc></micro-lc>.\\n\\nWhat are you waiting for? Unleash your creativity!\\n\\n## <micro-lc></micro-lc> has never been lighter\\n\\nIf you are familiar with <micro-lc></micro-lc> and you have already used it, you will love this new feature. If you are a new user, you will love it too, don\'t worry.\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> can now be used **through a [CDN](/docs/getting-started#import-from-cdn)**: this means that the download will be much lighter and the interface will be easier. This because <micro-lc></micro-lc> and `microlc-element-composer` (which used to be a separated core plugin) are now tightened together.  \\nThe bundle size is very low and so pages load faster, ensuring higher performances to your micro-frontends.\\n\\nIn addition, the code that makes <micro-lc></micro-lc> run is available as a standalone library that you can download via `npm`. Just run the following command:\\n\\n```shell\\nnpm i @micro-lc/orchestrator\\n```\\n\\n## New YAML integration\\n\\nBesides the already supported JSON, we introduced the possibility to **write [configuration](/api/micro-lc-web-component#configuration) in YAML**. Since YAML syntax is far more easily understandable for humans, this feature will boost you building your micro-frontends.\\n\\nBut, if you are a JSON lover, you can continue to use it as you have been doing until now. You can also use the converter available in the [Playground section](/playground/) to easily convert your YAML to JSON, and viceversa.\\n\\n## ... and a lot of other cool stuff\\n\\nBesides all the above, other new features and improvements have been added:\\n\\n- New [communication](/docs/concepts/communication) method between applications;\\n- <micro-lc></micro-lc> now supports centralized states from plugin;\\n- <micro-lc></micro-lc> is embeddable everywhere, so you can use it without downloading it;\\n- You can have custom [layouts](/docs/guides/layout) by default.\\n- The documentation has been updated and fully restyled!\\n\\nThat\'s it for now, but we will keep updating and improving <micro-lc></micro-lc>.\\n\\nIf you want to **contribute** to the project, take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc/issues), and feel free to open a new one if you don\'t find what you are looking for.  \\nMoreover, the [blog section](/blog) has been introduced on the website, so consider writing a post for sharing your experience building awesome micro-frontends!"},{"id":"micro-lc-the-new-open-source-micro-fronted-orchestrator","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/micro-lc-the-new-open-source-micro-fronted-orchestrator","editUrl":"https://github.com/micro-lc/documentation/edit/main/blog/2021-09-09-announcing-micro-lc.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-09-announcing-micro-lc.md","title":"micro-lc: the new open-source project for micro frontend orchestration","description":"micro-lc version 2.0 is out now!

We know the challenges and needs of those who work with micro frontends and we want to give a concrete contribution to the developers who use them. For this reason, we have released the project in **open\u2011source** mode: it is already available on [GitHub](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc) and all the community can freely contribute.\\n\\nWhat is micro frontend orchestration? And, what are the benefits of <micro-lc></micro-lc>? Read the article below to discover everything you need to know about it.\\n\\n![micro-lc architecture](/img/blog/microlc_architecture.png)\\n\\n## Micro frontends: what are they and what do you need them for?\\n\\nIn the last decades, developers have been used to breaking down the most complex elements into small, independent, standardized components and therefore more easily manageable and reusable.\\n\\nThe microservices architectural pattern has become popular as it allows to simplify and speed up the development of applications; in the same way **micro frontends** were born and they **apply to the frontend the same decoupling logic that microservices perform for the backend**. The goal is to unpack a frontend application into a series of reusable and modular components. This also allows you to improve the agility of new frontend features releases.\\n\\n## micro-lc: characteristics and benefits\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> is the component for micro frontend orchestration created by [Mia\u2011Platform](https://mia-platform.eu), which allows you **to make the development experience consistent**. <micro-lc></micro-lc> simplifies the management of micro frontends through an application. It includes all the backend and frontend parts, and allows their extension via plugins, which is necessary to develop frontend applications, thus speeding up the time-to-market of new solutions.\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> is composed of two releasable entities: a frontend part and a backend part.\\n\\nThe **frontend part** consists of a container that provides a series of cross-application functionalities that can be used to configure each connected frontend.\\n\\nAmong the features you can find:\\n\\n- The basic elements of the layout, namely the top bar and the menu (of three types: sidebar menu, collapsible sidebar menu and top bar menu);\\n- Application colors;\\n- Logo and Favicon;\\n- Window title;\\n- Darkmode / lightmode;\\n- User data;\\n- Google analytics;\\n- Plugin Management.\\n\\nMia\u2011Platform also provides a series of core and open\u2011source plugins for <micro-lc></micro-lc>.  \\n`microlc-element-composer`, for example, allows you to compose the UI of the page dynamically, to create horizontal micro frontends.\\n\\nFrom the **backend** section you can **manage the configurations that define the elements of the frontend**, the user authentication, and configurations in general.\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> does not manage or authenticate users directly, but allows you to configure authentication endpoints, which will then be managed by an Authentication Provider.\\n\\nThe frontends are designed with **Qiankun**, a framework that injects the frontends into the DOM. In this way it is as if they are organically inside your application and integrated with each other (as opposed to what happens with iframes, where the frontends are isolated).\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> is integrated with [Mia\u2011Platform Console](https://mia-platform.eu/platform/console/): if you already use Mia\u2011Platform Console you can select the Plugin from the [Marketplace](https://mia-platform.eu/platform/mia-platform-marketplace/) and start a frontend application in a few clicks.\\n\\n![micro-lc communication](/img/blog/microlc-communication.png)\\n\\n## The benefits of micro frontend orchestration with micro-lc\\n\\nAs anticipated, the use of a micro frontend orchestrator like <micro-lc></micro-lc> allows you to **improve the micro frontend development experience**, simplifying the orchestration and abstracting the language used.\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> is a component integrated **into the Runtime phase**.  \\nUnlike the Buildtime integration - which requires you to release all the elements every time a change is made - the Runtime integration allows you to **simplify the release**.  \\nOnce a new configuration has been released from the backend section, you need to simply reload the page to see the changes of the individual components, without releasing all the elements individually.\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> is so **flexible** that allows you not only to create new frontend applications, but also to migrate from a monolith frontend to a micro frontend architecture, which will be faster and more agile.\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> **is extremely configurable**: the layout can be modified by inserting the brand\'s graphic assets, thus offering a personalized user experience.\\n\\n<micro-lc></micro-lc> is an open\u2011source project: this means that anyone who is part of the community can give feedback and contribute to the evolution of the product. Try <micro-lc></micro-lc>, let us know what you think and contribute with your ideas!\\n\\nGo to the [GitHub](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc) project or to the [documentation](https://micro-lc.io/docs).\\n\\nIf you want to learn more about **all Mia\u2011Platform open\u2011source software**, take a look at [this page](https://mia-platform.eu/dev/open-source-projects-software/) on our website.
