We are proud to announce <micro-lc></micro-lc> **v2.0**! A lot of new features have been implemented and optimized, making the tool more powerful than ever.

Let's take a closer look to what has changed.

## A new live playground

One of the main news is the new [playground](/documentation/playground/) available on the website. Here you can try <micro-lc></micro-lc> live, without the need to install anything: in the box on the right you will directly see the result. You are free to do all the experiments you like and test the full potential of <micro-lc></micro-lc>.

What are you waiting for? Unleash your creativity!

## Using <micro-lc></micro-lc> has never been easier

If you are familiar with <micro-lc></micro-lc> and you have already used it, you will love this new feature. If you are a new user, you will love it too, don't worry.  
<micro-lc></micro-lc> can now be used through a [CDN](/documentation/docs/getting-started#import-from-cdn): this means that the download will be much lighter and the interface will be easier. This because <micro-lc></micro-lc> and `microlc-element-composer` (which used to be a separated core plugin) are now tightened together.

In addition, the code that makes <micro-lc></micro-lc> run is available as a standalone library that you can download via `npm`.

## New YAML integration

Besides the already supported JSON, we introduced the possibility to write [configuration](/documentation/api/micro-lc-web-component#configuration) in YAML. Since YAML syntax is far more easily understandable for human, this feature will boost you building your microfrontends.

But, if you are a JSON lover, you can still continue using it.

## ... and a lot of other cool stuff

Besides all the above, other new features and improvements have been added:

- The bundle size is very low, so the page loads faster;
- New [communication](/documentation/docs/concepts/communication) method between application;
- <micro-lc></micro-lc> now supports centralized states from plugin;
- <micro-lc></micro-lc> is embeddable everywhere, so you can use it without downloading it;
- You can have custom [layouts](/documentation/docs/guides/layout) by default.
- The documentation has been updated and fully restyled!

That's it for now, but we will keep updating and improving <micro-lc></micro-lc>. If you want to contribute, take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/micro-lc/micro-lc/issues), and feel free to open a new one if you don't find what you are looking for.  
Moreover, the [blog section](/documentation/blog) has been introduced on the website, so consider writing a post for sharing your experience building awesome micro-frontends!
