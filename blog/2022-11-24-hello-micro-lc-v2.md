We are proud to announce <micro-lc></micro-lc> v2.0! A lot of new features have been implemented and optimized, making the tool more powerful than ever.

Let's take a closer look to what has changed.

## A new live playground

One of the main news is the new [playground](/documentation/playground/) available on the website. Here you can try <micro-lc></micro-lc> live, without the need to install anything: in the box on the right you will directly see the result. You are free to do all the experiments you like and test the full potential of <micro-lc></micro-lc>.

What are you waiting for? Unleash your creativity!

## Using <micro-lc></micro-lc> has never been easier

If you are familiar with <micro-lc></micro-lc> and you have already used it, you will love this new feature. If you are a new user, you will love it too, don't worry.  
<micro-lc></micro-lc> can now be used through a CDN: this means that the download will be much lighter and the interface will be easier. This because <micro-lc></micro-lc> and `microlc-element-composer` (which used to be a separated core plugin) are now tightened together.

In addition, the code that makes <micro-lc></micro-lc> run is available as a standalone library that you can download via `npm`.

## New YAML integration

Besides the already supported JSON, we introduced the possibility to write the configurations in YAML. Since YAML syntax is far more easily understandable for human, this feature will boost you building your microfrontends.

But, if you are a JSON lover, you can still continue using it.

## ... and a lot of other cool stuff

Besides all the above, other new features and improvements have been added:

- The bundle size is very low, so the page loads faster;
- New communication method between application;
- <micro-lc></micro-lc> now supports centralized states from plugin;
- <micro-lc></micro-lc> is embeddable everywhere, so you can use it without downloading it;
- You can have custom layouts by default.
